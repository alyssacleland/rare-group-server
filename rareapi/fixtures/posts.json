      "content": "Everyone knows names like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift, but there are so many insanely talented women out there making bold, beautiful, genre-pushing music who don’t get half the attention they deserve. Start with Raveena — her voice is pure silk and her lyrics are poetic without being pretentious. Then check out Yaya Bey, who blends jazz, R&B, and spoken word in a way that feels both fresh and timeless. I’d also put Indigo De Souza on this list for her unapologetic grunge-pop vibes. These artists aren’t just 'promising' — they’re already doing incredible work. Give them a listen, and you’ll see what I mean.",

And honestly? Fair. I’ve had full conversations with her about whether Bon Iver is depressing or peaceful. She’s witnessed me cry to Phoebe Bridgers and also fist-pump to a remix of a Mario Kart theme. Zero judgment in her eyes — just deep, exhausted observation. I like to think she secretly enjoys it, or at least finds it comforting in some weird dog way. Either way, she never leaves the room. That’s love, I guess.",
